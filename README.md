# MicroMonitor
Full-featured system monitoring menubar app for macOS with support for SMC sensors

## Note
As of August 2019, MicroMonitor does not run on macOS Mojave and cannot be compiled in the current version of Xcode.

As of August 2020, Apple appears to have flagged MicroMonitor as malware and blocks it from running on macOS Catalina.

### Features:
* CPU, memory, disk, and network usage monitoring
* Temperature, fan speed, voltage, current, and power usage monitoring
* Graphical display of the information that matters most
* Able to free up inactive memory
* Support for over 160 SMC sensors
* Lightweight app with low CPU and memory usage
* Works on every Intel Mac with macOS 10.10 or newer

Note: MicroMonitor is not under active development and is unlikely to be updated in the future unless updates are necessary to ensure compatibility with new versions of macOS. 

MicroMonitor is released under the GPL v3 license. Uses [SMCWrapper](https://github.com/FergusInLondon/SMCWrapper) by @FergusInLondon.
