# MicroMonitor
Full-featured system monitoring menubar app for macOS with support for SMC sensors

### Features:
* CPU, memory, disk, and network usage monitoring
* Temperature, fan speed, voltage, current, and power usage monitoring
* Graphical display of the information that matters most
* Able to free up inactive memory
* Support for over 160 SMC sensors
* Lightweight app with low CPU and memory usage
* Works on every Intel Mac with macOS 10.10 or newer

Note: MicroMonitor is not under active development (I finished it over a year ago but have not released it until now) and is unlikely to be updated in the future unless updates are necessary to ensure compatibility with new versions of macOS. 

MicroMonitor is released under the GPL v3 license. Uses [SMCWrapper](https://github.com/FergusInLondon/SMCWrapper) by @FergusInLondon.
